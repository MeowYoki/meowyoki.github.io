        <h2>THE INTERNET AND THE WEB</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Internet is the interconnection of networks for the purpose of exchanging
            information.</li>
            <li>The World Wide Web is the collection of computers (servers and clients) that host
            webpages for anyone with Internet access can view.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>WEB STANDARDS AND ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Internet is not owned by any single individual or entity.</li>
            <li>There are standards that should be followed so that all people can access the
            information available – Accessibility. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
            states that anyone that creates webpages should make them available and
            understandable to anyone with disabilities</li>
            <li>These standards are created and recommended by a group of people called the
            World Wide Web Consortium or “W3C” for short. Keep in mind there are no specific
            rules for creating webpages, however; in order to reach the most people from all
            walks of life these standards are highly recommended</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INFORMATION ON THE WEB</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep in mind that not all the information on the web is viable or true. Searching for
                specific information needs to be validated hopefully by more than one website. We
                hope that the information we are seeking is trustworthy, but we also need to realize
                there are many unethical uses for the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>NETWORK OVERVIEW</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A network is a collection of two or more computers to share information. Within this
                collection is the Client/Server Model.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>THE CLIENT/SERVER MODEL</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The client/server model is the basis of how the Internet works.</li>
            <li>When you sit at your computer, tablet, or Smartphone you are the Client</li>
            <li>When you are browsing or working within an app and you request information you</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INTERNET PROTOCOLS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols define how communications between a client and server are established.</li>
            <li>The three most popular protocols used by web developers are:
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)<br>
                        The instructions needed to transfer files from one location to another</li>
                    <li>Email Protocols<br>
                        The most commonly used email protocols are SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol),<br>
                        and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).</li>
                    <li>HTTP or HTTPS<br><br>
                        HyperText Transfer Protocol is the set of rules needed for a browser
                        to read the webpage code and display it as intended. <br><br>
                        These rules are browser dependent and the code should meet the<br>
                        requirements of each type of browser collectively.<br>
                        This is accomplished via Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).<br><br>
                        The “s” at the end of HTTPS is to inform the user that the webpage is
                        secure and encrypted.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>URLS AND DOMAIN NAMES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A URL or Uniform Resource Locator is basically where the resources such as
                images, videos, webpages, etc. are located.</li>
            <li>Domain names locate the server(s) that holds the information/resources users
                request.</li>
            <li>As seen in this image we have the http protocol, the web server, the domain name, a
                directory, and the file. This is the full URL or website address.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>MARKUP LANGUAGES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)<br>
                The most popular of web development languages. It provides the instructions
                that a browser uses to display webpages.</li>
            <li>XML (Extensible Markup Language<br>
                XML provides flexibility to a developer. It doesn’t replace HTML but the two
                work together.
                § The use of XML allows developers to create their own tags that better
                describe their information as seen in the image below.</li>
            <li>XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language)<br>
                This language uses both XML and HTML4.
                § Notice the html !DOCTYPE and the XHTML encoding.</li>
            <li>HTML5
                HTML5 is the latest and greatest version of HTML.
                It is intended to replace HTML4 and XHTML with new elements, form edits,
                and video rendering.
                The W3C, as of 2017, approved its recommendations for HTML5.1, which is
                the syntax we’ll use throughout this series.</li>
        </ul>
